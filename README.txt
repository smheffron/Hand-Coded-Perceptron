Essential Requirements to run code:
    1.) python 3 installed 
    2.) numpy installed
 
How to run the code locally:
    1.) change to directory with the .py file you want to run
    2.) run the code using the command "python A1Part1.py"
    
How to run the code on Jupiter (preferred):
    1.) click on the "upload" button and select A1Part1.ipynb
    2.) click on the uploaded file, this will load it in Jupiter
    3.) click on "cell -> run all" option in the task bar
    
Interpreting the results:
    1.)When the program is run it will print out the following for 1000 epochs and a learning rate of .01:
        A.) A list of the weights and biases for each perspective node in the neural network
            Note: the bias for each perspective node is included as the last weight of its list
        B.) A list of the desired and actual outputs of the network
